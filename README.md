#mcApi Libraries

Browser and Node.js libraries for using the [Marvel Comics API](http://developer.marvel.com). Made by me for PERSONAL fun and use. In other words, this is not an official nor an endorsed Marvel product.

Documentation for each library can be found in their README.md files. Click on the respective folders to read them now.
